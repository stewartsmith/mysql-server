# BUG#40045: Replication failure on RBR + no PK + UPDATE + integer key + char
# with no key
#
# BUG#40007: Replication failure with RBR + no PK + 2 indexed fields 
#
# TEST DESCRIPTION
# ================
#
#   This test is structure in seven cases. In all of them, roughly the same
#   update and delete operations are performed, but what changes are the keys
#   in the table: 
#      no keys, one key, composite key (but only half is used in query),
#      unique key, primary key
#   
#   The seven cases are distinct because the engine on both and master and
#   slave varies:
#      
#      - On rpl_row_record_find_myisam.test (this) test file:
#        CASE 1:  MyISAM - master, MyISAM - slave
#           test without HA_PARTIAL_COLUMN_READ engine on master and on slave
#
#      - On rpl_row_record_find_falcon.test:
#        CASE 2:  Falcon - master, Falcon - slave
#           test with HA_PARTIAL_COLUMN_READ engine on master and on slave
#        CASE 3:  Falcon - master, MyISAM - slave
#           test with HA_PARTIAL_COLUMN_READ engine on master but not on slave
#        CASE 4:  MyISAM - master, Falcon - slave
#           test without HA_PARTIAL_COLUMN_READ engine on master but with it on slave
#           (Falcon)
#
#      - On rpl_row_record_find_innodb.test:
#        CASE 5:  InnoDB - master, MyISAM - slave
#           test with HA_PARTIAL_COLUMN_READ engine on master but not on slave
#           (InnoDB)
#        CASE 6:  InnoDB - master, InnoDB - slave
#           test with HA_PARTIAL_COLUMN_READ engine on master and on slave
#           (InnoDB)
#        CASE 7:  MyISAM - master, InnoDB - slave
#           test without HA_PARTIAL_COLUMN_READ engine on master but with it on slave
#           (InnoDB)
#
#   NOTE: In this file we also perform a sanity check by running the test
#         cases to verify some of the BUGS.
