# If a test has side effects, then it can be disabled for local testing purposes.
#
# Attention: Never ever push disabled tests. This is for local purposes only.
#    Only exception is for tests which are considered as "won't fix" for long time,
#    which should probably be attached to a bug report instead.
#    Also please keep the list sorted.
