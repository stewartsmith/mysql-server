#
# The falcon_team test suite is intended for unstable or otherwise
# intermittently failing Falcon-related tests.
# Stable Falcon tests are located in the falcon test suite.
#
# All tests in the falcon_team test suite should be associated with 
# a bug report describing the test failure or issue related to the test.
# These bugs should be pritoritized and fixed.
#
# Also, all the tests in the falcon_team suite should be marked as 
# "experimental" which is what this file is for (see README.experimental 
# for details). This is because we want to mark failures separately from 
# other failures when running multiple test suites in "Pushbuild 2" 
# (MySQL in-house integration testing).
#
# Note that a separate bug report is usually needed - it is
# NOT sufficient to list the ID of the bug which fix a test is 
# supposed to verify.
#
# Format:
#  Full test case name    # BugId - BugDescription or other useful info
#
# Example:
#  falcon_team.falcon_deadlock                # Bug#43554 - Intermittent lock-wait-timeout in falcon_deadlock test
#
# Do not use TAB characters for whitespace.
# Keep the list sorted by test name.
