# The falcon_team test suite is intended for unstable or otherwise
# intermittently failing Falcon-related tests.
# Stable Falcon tests are located in the falcon test suite.
#
# All tests in the falcon_team test suite should be associated with 
# a bug report describing the test failure or issue related to the test.
#
# Note that a separate bug report is usually needed for this, it is
# not sufficient to list the ID of the bug whose fix this test is 
# supposed to verify.
#
# Format:
#  Test case: BugId - BugDescription
#
# Do not use TAB characters for whitespace.
# Keep the list sorted by test name.
