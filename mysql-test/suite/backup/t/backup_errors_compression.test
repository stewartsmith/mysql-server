#
# This test is created as part of WL#4408 to test all the error conditions for
# backup command with compression. There is already an existing 
# test(backup_errors) which tests all the error conditions for backup.
# The same error conditions needs to be checked for backup command with 
# compression option. In such case, there is no need to repeat the entire test
# for backup with compression option.
# 
# In backup_errors test, the original BACKUP statement is extended with 
# $compression variable (and eval must be used so that the value of $compression# is substituted). 
# This way a single test script backup_errors will define all the error 
# scenarios and we will be able to run them with and without compression. 
# To run without compression, backup_errors will be executed as before. 
# NOTE: When backup_errors test is executed, nothing will change
# because variable $compression is undefined and expands to empty string
#
# To run the same tests with compression, the backup_errors_compression.test is 
# created.
